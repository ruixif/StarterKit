# StarterKit
A starterkit of necessary knowledge to finish your work programmtically and efficiently on a computer. 

## Basic knowledge on data structures and algorithms

My suggestion is a subset of and based on [CLRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms). This book is fantastic and its title, "introduction to algorithms", means that it is written for beginners on algorithms. 

+ Growth of complexity, Big-O notation
+ High-level ideas:
  + Divide-Conquer-Combine strategy
+ Sorting 
  + Quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, InsertionSort
  + Shell sort, Radix sort

### Testing your skills

Practice on some "core" leetcode problems (written in Chinese). Build some muscle memory.

## Languages

+ Programming 
If you have not programmed for a while or new to programming, pick a handy and popular programming languages such as `Python` or `Java`.
They are easy to learn and good for coding interview (in case your new job requires it).

+ Decriptive languages:
  + yaml
  + toml
  + json


## Tools

+ [Linux basic operations](https://github.com/ruixif/StarterKit/blob/master/LinuxBeginner.md)
