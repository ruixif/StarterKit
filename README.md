# LinuxBeginner
A simple list of necessary linux commands and knowledge. Actually Linux users are encoraged to look into GNU coreutils, but that can be too overwhelming for my absolute-beginner friends. Thus I made this list to smoothen the learning curve.


## Necessary hardwares

A personal computer with any mainstream Linux distro (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc), or a Mac OS, or a chip computer like Rasberry Pi. 

## knowledge
+ environmental variables: $PATH, $JAVA_HOME

## bash commands

### fundamentals 
+ man
+ ls
+ cp
+ mv
+ mkdir
+ diff
+ top
+ cat
+ fg
+ bg

### text processing
+ sed
+ grep
+ awk

### a little more
+ vim
+ tmux

### remote
+ ssh
+ scp
+ rsync

### execution
+ parallel
