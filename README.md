# StarterKit
A starterkit of necessary knowledge to finish your work programmtically and efficiently on a computer. 

## Basic knowledge on data structures and algorithms

My suggestion is a subset of and based on [CLRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms). This book is fantastic and its title, "introduction to algorithms", means that it is written for beginners on algorithms. 

+ Growth of complexity, Big-O notation
+ High-level ideas:
  + Divide-Conquer-Combine strategy
+ Sorting 
  + Quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, InsertionSort
  + Shell sort, Radix sort, bucket sort,
+ Elementary data structures 
  + Stack
  + LinkedList, Doubly linkedlist
  + Queue, Dequeue
  + Pointer and Object
  + Allocating, reallocating and freeing: (consider the implementation of Vector in C++ template, or ArrayList in Java)
  + Hashtable
+ Tree
  + Binary search tree
     + Tree traversal: In-order, post-order, pre-order
  + Balanced binary tree: red-black, AVL
  + Trie
  + B-tree
+ PriorityQueue
+ Graph
  + BST
  + DST
+ More
  + Bloom Filter
  + Skip list
  + Disjoint Sets
  + Trie/Radix Trie
  + Interval tree
  + Segment tree
  + Binary Indexed tree
  + Range Tree
  + Minimum Spanning Trees
  + Treemap
  + Genetic algorithm


### Testing your skills

Practice on some "core" leetcode problems (written in Chinese). Build some muscle memory.

## Languages

+ Programming 
If you have not programmed for a while or new to programming, pick a handy and popular programming languages such as `Python` or `Java`.
They are easy to learn and good for coding interview (in case your new job requires it).

+ Decriptive languages:
  + yaml
  + toml
  + json


## Tools

+ [Linux basic operations](https://github.com/ruixif/StarterKit/blob/master/LinuxBeginner.md)

+ Docker 

+ virtualenv

+ Building tools
  + Makefile
  + Maven/gradle
  + [setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html)

+ Connection to database
  + Jdbc libraries. 

## How to debug

+ Read the log or terminal output!
+ Read the stack trace!
+ Insert print or logging!
+ Learn how to use the debugger like [`gdb`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) or [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html).
